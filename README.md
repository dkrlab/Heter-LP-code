# Heter-LP-code
Heter-LP is a novel semi-supervised heterogeneous label propagation algorithm.
It integrates various types of data into a heterogeneous network and implements a label propagation algorithm to find new interactions.
This method is a semi-supervised method without requiring negative training samples, and capable of utilizing information 
from unlabelled samples. 
Furthermore, it is applicable in the case of the new entity problem. 
Lastly, integration of different data types is used to improve the prediction accuracy.
